# Additional Notes

## Tips for uploading to YouTube

1. **Initial upload order depends on the selection's file order in File Explorer. Always drag a selection by clicking the first file.** E.g. 5 files are selected in file explorer, ordered 1-5. 
    * If the user clicks on file 1 to drag, order will be 1-5
    * If the user clicks on file 3 to drag, order will be 3-5, 1-2
2. **Final video order on channel page depends on the order that the videos are published** (not the initial upload order)
3. **YouTube cannot publish a video until after SD version has finished processing. This may cause video order to be scrambled.** For example:
    * Video A is marked to be published earlier than video B
    * Video A takes a longer time to process SD version
    * Video A may end up being published after video B.
4. **Using YouTube** `bulk update` **to publish a selection of videos will scramble the publish order within the selection**
