# Additional Notes

## Tips for uploading to YouTube

* **Initial upload order depends on the selection's file order in File Explorer + which file is clicked.** E.g. 5 files are selected in file explorer, ordered 1-5. 
    * If the user clicks on file 1 to drag, order will be 1-5
    * If the user clicks on file 3 to drag, order will be 3-5, 1-2
* **Final video order on channel page depends on the order that the videos are published** (not the initial upload order)
* **YouTube cannot publish a video until after SD version has finished processing. This may cause video order to be scrambled.** For example:
    * Video A is marked to be published earlier than video B
    * Video A takes a longer time to process SD version
    * Video A may end up being published after video B.
* **Using YouTube** `bulk update` **to publish a selection of videos will scramble the publish order within the selection**

### If you are uploading multiple files and order does not matter ###

1. Drag selection to YouTube upload window
2. Use `bulk update` to publish. Select the relevant videos > edit > visibility > select `public` > update videos

### If you are uploading multiple files and order DOES matter ###

1. Drag selection to YouTube upload window by **clicking the first file**
2. Wait for all videos to finish processing the SD version
3. Publish video one by one according to your desired order.
